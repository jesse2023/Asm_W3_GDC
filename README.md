This repo is for the assignment of Getting and Cleanning Data, week 3.

The run_analysis.R script will automately begin once being loaded in the working space and generate a txt file with the tidy data set as the result in the working directory. The script is structured into 5 parts matching the 5 steps of the requirement. To run the script, one must also import package 'dplyr' and upzip the original data in the working directory with the structure inside the package unchanged.

For more detail description of the procedure of the script, please refer to the CodeBook.md file.
